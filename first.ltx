\section{History Altered---Impact of \index{Wars}War}

    The events and outcomes of wars can significantly change the way
    history is recorded, remembered, and understood, highlighting both
    the loss and the transformation of historical information due to
    conflict.

    Wars often have profound impacts on the preservation and
    interpretation of history. The fate of the facts known by the losing
    side, and the broader question of how history is recorded and
    understood, can be complex. Here's a general overview:

    \subsection{Loss of Historical Records}

        In wars, especially those involving significant destruction,
        historical records can be lost or destroyed. This includes
        archives, libraries, cultural artifacts, and other repositories
        of knowledge.\par

        The losing side's records may be deliberately destroyed or
        censored by the victors, or simply lost in the chaos of
        conflict.\par

    \subsection{One-Sided Narratives}

        The adage "history is written by the victors" reflects the
        reality that the winning side often has more influence over the
        post-war narrative. This can lead to a one-sided or biased
        account of events.\par

        The perspectives and experiences of the losing side might be
        minimized, ignored, or misrepresented.

    \subsection{Determining the Truth}

        Establishing a comprehensive and accurate historical account
        requires examining multiple sources and perspectives, including
        those of the losing side, neutrals, and third-party observers.\par

        Historians often cross-reference different types of evidence,
        such as documents, oral histories, archaeological findings, and
        others, to piece together a more balanced understanding.\par

    \subsection{Identifying Misinformation}

        Misinformation in historical accounts can be identified through
        rigorous scholarly research and peer review. Historians look for
        inconsistencies, check sources for credibility, and compare
        accounts across different records.\par

        Contextual analysis, understanding the source's bias, and the
        use of primary documents are critical in assessing the veracity
        of historical information.

    \subsection{Impact of Propaganda and Censorship}

        During and after wars, propaganda and censorship can
        significantly distort the truth. This can lead to the creation
        of myths or misconceptions that may persist long after the
        conflict.\par

        Unraveling these distortions requires critical examination and
        the willingness to challenge prevailing narratives.

\par
In summary, history can be lost or distorted in wars due to the
destruction of records, one-sided narratives, propaganda, and
censorship. Determining the truth and identifying misinformation
involves meticulous research and the examination of multiple, diverse
sources. The field of historiography (the study of how history is
written) deals extensively with these challenges, striving to understand
and interpret the past as accurately and impartially as possible.

\section{Evolution of Record-Keeping}

% From Ancient Methods to the Digital Era

    The journey of record-keeping mirrors the evolution of human
    civilization. From etchings on stone and clay tablets to ink on
